# Overview
A game engine using the C programing language and Vulkan. Compiling with Clang. 

This is a learning exercise for me. My primary resources are [Travis Vroman's Vulkan Game Engine series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6_WdnzQIQ4&list=PLv8Ddw9K0JPg1BEO-RS-0MYs423cvLVtj&index=3) and the [Foundations of Game Engine Development](https://foundationsofgameenginedev.com/) books by Eric Lengyel.
